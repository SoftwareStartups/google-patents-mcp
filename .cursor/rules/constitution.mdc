# Project Constitution

Core principles guiding this project's development.

## Development Philosophy

### Forward-Looking Approach

- **Never implement backward compatibility**
- Always implement according to the latest insight and best practices
- Refactor boldly when better approaches are identified
- Embrace breaking changes when they lead to better design

### Communication Style

- **Do not output verbose summaries of work done or changes implemented**
- Be concise and direct in responses
- Focus on what matters now, not what changed
- Let the code speak for itself

## Documentation Philosophy

- **Do not generate documentation files unless explicitly asked**
- Document the current, latest state only
- Never document changes or differences versus previous implementation
- Focus on clarity and accuracy in current state documentation
